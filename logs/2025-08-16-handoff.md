# Context Dump â€” 2025-08-16

## Background
- Working on **Context Vault** tools to help carry knowledge between ChatGPT sessions.  
- Added `ctxdump` to create/edit/commit/push narrative dumps.  
- Repo authentication fixed with SSH.  

## Key Events
- Debugged earlier ctx tools (`ctxnote`, `ctxrun`, `ctxsnap`, `ctxdiff`, `ctxsum`).  
- Confirmed vault is pushing logs, diffs, and snaps.  
- Added `docs/customize.md` to repo, containing ChatGPT reminder rules.  
- Planned alias `ctxdone` (to stop AutoLog, summarize, and push).  

## Current Status
- Repo healthy, syncing via SSH.  
- Tools usable, `ctxdump` ready.  
- Customize.md is in place, not yet pulled into session automatically.  

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- Try first `ctxdump` in practice.  
- Add `ctxdone` helper.  
- Enable session start/end reminders via `customize.md`.  
- Continue iterating on automation (auto-snapshot hooks later).
