# Context Dump â€” 2025-08-18

**Date:** 2025-08-18  
**Time:** 20:21 UTC  
**Title:** File Index Automation & Repo Integration

## Summary
- Built and refined `update-file-index` tool (Bash script).
- Integrated with `ctxdone` for automatic daily index refresh and push.
- Fixed repo detection, raw URL generation, and safe defaults.
- Decided against automatic renaming tool (too noisy / unhelpful).
- Next steps: rely on smarter log headers and context dumps for meaningful file names.

## Notes
- Connector upgrade path (ChatGPT Teams) deemed not cost-effective.
- Established raw URL workflow via GitHub as canonical method for assistant access.
- Debugging iterations completed; current script works end-to-end.

## Outcome
Repo now maintains an up-to-date `docs/file-index.md` that assistant can read to locate relevant logs and docs.
