# Cgpt-integration Project Archive

**Date:** 2025-08-16

## Background
- CachyOS (Hyprland) on Alienware Aurora R12, i9-11900KF, RTX 3080, 64 GiB RAM.
- Environment: fish shell, micro editor, kitty terminal.
- Created `cgpt` (wrapper around `clipgpt`) to clean ANSI codes, wrap in code-blocks, and copy terminal output for ChatGPT.

## Key Work
- Verified `cgpt` works with colorful outputs (`ls --color=always`).
- Added `-t` trim flag: truncates long outputs and appends “…output truncated…” notice.
- Confirmed `cgpt` copies clean content into clipboard, works with both wl-copy and paste.
- Debugged `dmesg` errors; learned it’s restricted unless run with sudo. Recommended using `journalctl -k -b --no-pager` instead.

## Current Status
- `cgpt` alias and function loaded via `~/.config/fish/config.fish`.
- Trim flag functional and clearly shows truncation message.
- Env reporting function `envdump` added to show system info in a clean format.

## Next Steps
- Use new chats to prevent lag.
- Optionally test `cgpt -t` with large outputs to validate truncation note.
- Push this archive into `context-vault` repo for continuity.
