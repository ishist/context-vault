# Context Dump – 2025-08-17 01:55:18Z

## Background
- Debugging why ChatGPT cannot access `ishist/context-vault` repo via connector.
- Confirmed GitHub connector indexing is flaky; repo is public for now.
- Using raw GitHub URL to fetch `docs/customize.md` as fallback.
- Goal: ensure `customize.md` is source of truth for environment + workflow.

## Decisions Made
- Added `ctxdone` command to replace multi-step end-of-session flow (`ctxoff → ctxsum → commit`).
- Updated `docs/customize.md` accordingly (committed + pushed).
- Built helper script **`ctxspec`** to streamline editing `customize.md`:
  - Pauses AutoLog (`ctxoff`), pulls latest repo, opens file in Micro, commits & pushes changes, then resumes AutoLog.
- Added “Spec Maintenance” section in `customize.md` noting fish heredoc issue (`cat <<EOF` doesn’t work; use Micro instead).
- Decided against adding AutoLog resume echo message for now.

## Current Status
- Repo accessible publicly via raw GitHub URLs.
- Connector access still not functioning (will report if it starts working).
- `ctxspec` is working and committed in `bin/`.
- AutoLog resumes correctly after `ctxspec`, verified with `ctxstatus`.
- Created and reviewed a **Session Close Checklist** but not saved to repo yet.

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- Keep repo public until connector indexing issue resolves; then remove raw URL fallback from “Other Information.”
- Optionally create `docs/cheatsheet.md` with session close checklist.
- Monitor lag in long chats → use `ctxdone` to close sessions cleanly and start fresh.
- Add more missing details into `customize.md` incrementally via `ctxspec`.
